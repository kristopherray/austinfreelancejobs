## Welcome to the Austin Freelance Jobs website!

Originally founded just weeks ago as a [Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/austinfreelancejobs/) our ambitions are quickly groups to support the Austin, TX freelance and job community. Our first initiative in our expanding infrastructure is the launch of a "central hub" or directory of freelancers that can help facilitate the connection between freelancers and organizations looking for their help.

Austin Freelance Jobs was born out of the passion we have for the community and a firm belief that the freelance economy is truly the future where the best work is created.

We are a small team of freelance industry leaders who have seen and reaped the benefits of what freelancing has to offer, and more than anything we want to help foster as much of the growth as we can bear.
