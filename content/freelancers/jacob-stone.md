I started my journey in video production back in high school, where I joined the video club. It was there that I first picked up a camera and discovered my deep-seated passion for the world of video production.

After high school, I took a different path and decided to serve in the military. I took a year off from school to undergo basic training and military police school. It was a transformative experience that instilled discipline and a sense of duty in me.
I immersed myself in this newfound passion, and it wasn't long before I graduated with a Bachelor's in Communications Media with a specialization in TV and video production.

Over the years, I had the privilege of working on various projects, including music videos, training videos, commercials, and narrative films. With each project, I expanded my skill set and further nurtured my passion for filmmaking.

Today, I continue to grow my skills and expand my portfolio, as I continue my career as a video professional.
