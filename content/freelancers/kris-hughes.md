I'm the founder of Zanate Ventures, an Austin-based content studio that focuses on social media ghostwriting, email marketing, marketing consulting, and thought leadership content.

Over the past 4 years our business has grown consistently year over year through working with clients all over the world to help them own their voice and tell a unique story that highlights what makes their brand different and the obvious choice for potential clients.

I've worked in the content world for over 14 years, building my own blogs, selling blogs, building and managing content teams, ghostwriting, writing on bylines, creating drip campaigns, building thought leadership campaigns, and just about anything else you can imagine related to content.

I look forward to chatting about your project needs!

I'm always interested to discuss new freelancing projects - especially fractional projects - and look forward to chatting sometime!
