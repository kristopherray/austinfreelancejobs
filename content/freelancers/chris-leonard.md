Howdy, I’m Chris. I’m a software engineer with over 25 years of experience. During my career, I have been a freelancer, a senior full-stack engineer, and a technical co-founder of a computational linguistics startup. My current focus is the Python programming language and I’m a co-organizer of the Austin Python Meetup. I love planning, architecting, and building complex apps as much as I love quick automation scripts, exploring data, and automation.
