I do semantic SEO, technical SEO, marketing automations, ad strategy, ad execution (API conversions anyone?), 1st party script setup to better leverage your data, GTM, GA4 dashboards optimizations, SEO optimized web development, social media strategy / management, and my latest tools in the tool kit is AI development. Woot woot.

I am currently finishing my post graduate certification at UT in AI / Machine learning. My goal is to have a deeper understanding on how I can enable tech to better help growth efforts for businesses. I am already applying it in various training models, AI chatbot developments, and custom SEO tools built on top of chatGPT. And it's super fun.
